## Method Descriptions

### 1. Newton Raphson Method
Folder: 1. Newton Raphson Method

The Newton-Raphson method is a numerical technique used to find the roots of a real-valued function. It starts with an initial guess and iteratively refines the estimate until it converges to the desired root.

### 2. Bisection Method
Folder: 2. Bisection Method

The bisection method is a simple numerical method used to find the roots of a continuous function within a given interval. It works by repeatedly dividing the interval in half and narrowing down the search space until the root is found.

### 3. Solution by Trapezoidal and Simpsons Rule
Folder: 3. Solution by Trapezoidal and Simpsons Rule

These notebooks contain implementations of the trapezoidal rule and Simpson's rule, which are numerical techniques for approximating definite integrals. These methods are particularly useful for functions that are not easy to integrate analytically.

### 4. Linear Interpolation
Folder: 4. Linear Interpolation

Linear interpolation is a basic numerical technique used to estimate values between data points. It constructs a straight line between two known data points and uses it to approximate the value at a given point.

### 5. Gauss Elimination
Folder: 5. Gauss Elimination

Gauss elimination is an algorithm used to solve systems of linear equations. It simplifies the system by applying elementary row operations to transform it into row-echelon form and then back-substituting to obtain the solutions.
![Program 5](https://github.com/Aditya-Tiwary/Mathematica-Programs-for-Numerical-Methods/assets/83766476/be08cf1b-cdd0-461d-9686-2a95e737ab6c)

### 6. Gauss-Jordan Elimination
Folder: 6. Gauss-Jordan Elimination

Similar to Gauss elimination, Gauss-Jordan elimination is another method to solve systems of linear equations. However, it goes further by transforming the system into reduced row-echelon form, leading to a unique and simplified solution.
![Program 6](https://github.com/Aditya-Tiwary/Mathematica-Programs-for-Numerical-Methods/assets/83766476/905e3960-1423-4034-8fbb-aee2bff63c81)

### 7. Second Order Runge-Kutta Method
Folder: 7. Second Order Runge-Kutta Method

The second-order Runge-Kutta method, also known as the midpoint method, is a numerical technique to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of the form dy/dx = f(x, y). It provides a more accurate approximation compared to the Euler method.

### 8. Regula Falsi Method
Folder: 8. Regula Falsi Method

The regula falsi method, also known as the false position method, is an iterative technique used to find the roots of a continuous function within a given interval. It is similar to the bisection method but uses a linear interpolation approach for convergence.

## How to Use

Each folder contains a Mathematica notebook (.nb) that corresponds to the respective numerical method. To use the programs, simply open the notebooks in Mathematica. You can modify the input data or function as needed for your specific use case.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different inputs, and adapt the programs for your numerical analysis tasks.
